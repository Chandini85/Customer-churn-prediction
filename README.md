## Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the scenario where customers stop using a company’s product or service. Accurately predicting churn helps businesses take proactive measures to retain customers and improve overall profitability.

The model analyzes customer behavior, usage patterns, and demographic data to identify customers who are at high risk of leaving.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses because:

- Acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones  
- Loss of customers directly impacts revenue  
- Manual analysis of churn patterns is inefficient for large datasets  

This project aims to automate churn prediction using machine learning models that deliver accurate and actionable insights.

## 🧠 Solution Approach
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand churn patterns  
- Applied data preprocessing techniques such as encoding and scaling  
- Built machine learning classification models  
- Evaluated model performance using standard classification metrics  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Machine Learning (Classification Models)  

## 📂 Dataset
- Customer data including demographics, account details, and service usage  
- Publicly available customer churn datasets (e.g., telecom churn datasets)  

## ⚙️ Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and validation  
- Churn prediction and performance evaluation  

## 📈 Results
- Successfully identified customers with high churn probability  
- Model demonstrates strong predictive performance on unseen data  
- Provides insights that can support customer retention strategies  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy using ensemble and boosting techniques  
- Deploy the model as a web application or REST API  
- Integrate real-time customer data for live churn prediction
